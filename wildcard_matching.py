Time Complexity: O(mn) for the 2 pointer approach
Space Complexity : O(mn) for DP approach and O(1) for the 2 pointer approach
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : No

approach would be the 2 pointer aproach. Here, we assign 2 extra pointers as p* and s*. We start iterating over the string and
the pattern. Now we have 4 cases. If char at s and p match, so we just increase the s and p pointer. In case, its a *. we just take the
0 case as of now, put p* at p and increment p, considering we did not expand *. Another case would be if p is still -1, we just
return False. At the end, if p is also not -1 and there is no match, that means we could have taken 1 case for *. So we go back,
increase s* by 1, put s there, put p to p*, and start our traversal from there. In the end when we reached end of s but we still have
values left in p, so if all are *, we could return True,but if any character is still left in p, there wont be a match and we can return
False.
