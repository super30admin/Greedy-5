#Approach:
#1. Initailize array for workers, bikes, result. map for dist-->pair(worker,bike) map.
#2.Sort the hashMap in acc to distance whihch is calculated taking abs of x and y cordinates of workers and bikes.
#3.Iterate through values of the hashMap, and check if worker and bikes are already True or not, if not make them true and append the worker num,ber to result array.
